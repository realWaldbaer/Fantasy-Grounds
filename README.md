# Fantasy-Grounds
Data files, modules and things to use with Fantasy Grounds
The first module work will be done for the Role Playing System/Ruleset of Traveller.
Of course without harming any Copyright or things that may not be public. 
I will translate the Core Rule Book for use within the Fantasy Grounds Evironment.
This is a German version of the Rules.
